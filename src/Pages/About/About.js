                            A web developer is a programmer who specializes in,
                            or is specifically engaged in, the development of
                            World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server
                            model.
                            <hr />I am Zesan. My goal is in 2022 to become a
                            fullstack developer. It is so much challanging to
                            me. But I have to do it.I want to be a fullstack
                            developer. I want to move forward with this in mind.
                            I think 2022 is going to be the most challenging for
                            me. And it will bring the biggest change in my life
                            inshallah.
